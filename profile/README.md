As of 2024, we do not actively maintain this code base anymore. If you want to reproduce our research or are interested in running it locally, have a look at our [examples](https://github.com/AuthenticExecution/examples) to get started. To understand the actual commands to run, check out the [workflows](https://github.com/AuthenticExecution/examples/actions). 

We are happy to discuss issues and merge PRs but will not be able to actively fix issues when they arise. For urgent matters, please contact [Gianluca Scopelliti](https://bobspot.org).
